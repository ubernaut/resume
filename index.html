<h1>Project History</h1>

<h2>FAA</h2>

<h4>AWS Federal Cloud Services migration and refactor</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Architect, Project Manager, Administrator</em></strong> <br />
Leading a large team from Amazon and multiple contractors tasked with migrating the Weather Camera Program's IT infrastructure (50 services and 4 environments) into FCS and the Mission Support network. The project involves decoupling the existing apps from cloud vendor specific services like App Engine and migrating them into portable containers managed by kubernetes. Many challenges exist in terms of authorization from various groups around the FAA, meeting the enhanced security controls required of the Mission Support network, and ramping the existing team up on the technology required to ensure a successful migration and refactor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FAA &amp; Leidos</h2>

<h4>360 Camera Implementation (FAA and Leidos)</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Team Lead, Sr. Software Engineer, Network Engineer, Software Architect</em></strong> <br />
Lead a small team and implemented a new 360 degree camera system for the FAA Weather Camera Program. This project required a broad range of skills: researching and testing new cameras, design of ground up camera systems,  integration of those systems into FAA control electronics, low latency video encoding, data transmission over cellular networks,  browser based WebGL reprojection of live video feeds to improve image quality, and developing a new web based interface.</li>

Notable UI features included the ability for any user to build custom queries which could be saved and optionally displayed on their customized homepage. We also used AJAX to shape data into proper formats to speed up data entry. Notable architectural enhancements include a control binding class which enabled us to easily bind data to and from UI controls simply by looping through a list of the control binding class. For each control binding, our app would recursively search the page for the right control and bind it to the data depending on the type of control.</li>
