<h1>Project History</h1>
<h1>Federal Aviation Administration</h1>
<h3>May 2020 - Present</h3>
<p>Worked as the IT lead managing simultaneous software projects and operations of the camera network, websites, and infrastructure required to support them.</p>
<h4>AWS Federal Cloud Services migration and refactor (ongoing)</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Architect, Project Manager, Administrator</strong></em><br>Leading a large team from Amazon and multiple contractors tasked with migrating the Weather Camera Program&#39;s IT infrastructure (50 services and 4 environments) into FCS and the Mission Support network. The project involves decoupling the existing apps from cloud vendor specific services like App Engine and migrating them into portable containers managed by kubernetes. Many challenges exist in terms of authorization from various groups around the FAA, meeting the enhanced security controls required of the Mission Support network, and ramping the existing team up on the technology required to ensure a successful migration and refactor.</li>
</ul>
<h4>360 Camera Implementation</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Team Lead, Sr. Software Engineer, Network Engineer, Software Architect</strong></em><br>Lead a small team and implemented a new 360 degree camera system for the FAA Weather Camera Program. This project required a broad range of skills: researching and testing new cameras, design of ground up camera systems,  integration of those systems into FAA control electronics, low latency video encoding, data transmission over cellular networks,  browser based WebGL reprojection of live video feeds to improve image quality, and developing a new web based interface.</li>
</ul>
<h5>AvCams Plus</h5>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sr. Software Engineer, Project Manager, Software Architect</strong></em><br>Lead the team charged with building AvCamsPlus <a href="https://weathercams.faa.gov">https://weathercams.faa.gov</a> the successor to <a href="https://avcams.faa.gov">https://avcams.faa.gov</a> (now redirected).  AvCamsPlus is a Progressive Web Application running on Google Cloud Platform and built with Postgres, Node.js, and React. The goal of this project was to use modern technologies and web based standards to create a cutting edge, responsive website to keep pilots informed in order for them to make the safest decisions possible. AvCamsPlus imports and displays large amounts of data from external sources including the NWS, FAA, and Google Maps.  This project required extensive knowledge of GIS, emerging web standards, as well as long term project planning and execution experience.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Google Cloud Serverless Migration</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sr. Software Engineer, Network Engineer, Software Architect</strong></em><br>Led the team which converted AvCams Plus to a serverless architecture, eliminating a significant amount of maintenance overhead by using the Google App Engine instead of virtual machines.

</ul>
<h4>PIREPS</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Sr. Software Engineer, Team Lead</strong></em><br>Lead a small team of developers who created two new interfaces for submitting Pilot Reports. These interfaces solved multiple issues related to data quality and input validation. One version is a desktop focused interface aimed at providing the full extent of PIREP input options. The second version is a mobile focused app with many innovations aimed at simplifying the process of creating a PIREP and inventing many new custom user interface controls to enable completion of a PIREP using only one hand.</li>

<h3>State of Alaska Department of Public Safety</h3>
<h4>ARMS Inventory</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Programmer</strong></em>
With State of Alaska, Department of Public Safety, worked in a two person development team to design and build a web-application used by warehouse employees and state troopers to request supplies, keep inventory, and order products from vendors. Using the Model View Controller design pattern, built a web application from the ground up, designing a unique database to suit their needs. Using Microsoftâ€™s Linq technology we were able to accelerate our work by automatically generating the Model later. Notable UI enhancements include responsive AJAX panels and controls which are displayed and hidden when needed. Other AJAX tools were used to accelerate end-user data entry and improve responsiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>State of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation</h3>
<h4>SWIM</h4>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Jr. Programmer</strong></em>
 Designed and built the Solid Waste Information Management System. A web-based landfill data aggregator. Using the Model View Controller design pattern we designed and implemented the database, created a model layer which mirrored the entities found in the database, a data manager layer which saved the model layerâ€™s entities to the database, a controller layer which held any business ruled and logic that couldnâ€™t be encapsulated in the database or model layer, and many user interface pages. Notable UI features included the ability for any user to build custom queries which could be saved and optionally displayed on their customized homepage. We also used AJAX to shape data into proper formats to speed up data entry. Notable architectural enhancements include a control binding class which enabled us to easily bind data to and from UI controls simply by looping through a list of the control binding class. For each control binding, our app would recursively search the page for the right control and bind it to the data depending on the type of control.</li>
