## Values and Aphorisms

I'm looking for a leadership role on an ambitious team who is anticipating how current trends and technology will shape the world. Manifest your dreams!

I work best in areas I can be passionate, for leaders with ambitious vision, in organizations where top performers have latitude.  

I'm interested in VR, WebXR, WebGPU, Web3, distributed computing, crypto, decentralized services and protocols, computational physics, Open Source, entrepreneurship, aerospace, and rocking the boat.

It's important to capture the initiative early and maintain it. Show significant visual progress early and often. I love demonstrating and rapidly building functional proof of concept applications. These will do more communicating in 30 seconds than 30 years of PowerPoint presentations.

Never listen to people who tell you a project is too ambitious or impossible. Try to build it, you'll be amazed at what you can accomplish in the time you would have wasted trying to convince the timid.

The places you least want to look are more likely to contain the solutions to your long lived problems.

Continually reassess your assumptions from first principles. Constraints may no longer hold.

### Architecture & Refactoring
No set of requirements will ever be complete or correctly weighted at the start. Focus on providing a flexible architecture that can adapt to changes throughout the Software Development Life Cycle.

Fancy ORM is great until you need to do something a little weird.

When first being exposed to a legacy codebase you are biased towards a total replacement because you do not understand the details. When you are familiar with a legacy codebase you are biased against replacement because you now understand the details. Be aware of, and counter these biases in yourself and your team.

If you are working in an existing project with a long history, follow the conventions unless you plan on refactoring the whole project. When you encounter bizarre complexity it's a sign you don't understand the problem. It's important to keep notes on these things because by the time you understand the project as a whole you may be too indoctrinated in its constraints and conventions to remember what it was you wanted to fix in the first place.

When writing an app for an organization to be used by employees get a big picture from the managers and then interview the users.  Make sure to observe the users during crunch time and the most time consuming aspects of their existing processes will jump out at you. Make sure to sit with both top performers and poor performers. Managers will push you towards the best employees but it's the poor performers who are having issues with the process.  Usability insights will come from the people having trouble not from the people doing well.

### Navigating Bureaucracy  
Organizations are subject to entropy. Bureaucracy will expand and atrophy until it can barely function.  Disruption and reversal is possible only with a large external source of energy. Disruption of existing order will always be painful.

For ambitious projects: Find good people and give them latitude. Shield them from the bureaucracy. Refine and adapt your project to your processes after you have something tangible. Best practices are critical, adherence to policy must be weighted against time, short and long term goals of the project, the big picture, and goals of the organization. It should not be done lightly. Great developers and leaders know how to balance these within the scope of their authority. This balance is different for every team, project, and organization.

You must be aligned with power in an organization in order for your initiative to succeed.  Trying to act without it will result in being caught up by endless small but time consuming policy transgressions.  Acting while in alignment feels like policy doesn't exist. The winds will shift rapidly but you can often predict it if you are cognizant of how outside forces influence the organization.

Policy is an impersonal method of control which exists ostensibly to protect the organization and enforce standardization. If necessary it can be easily changed. In practice it is a blunt tool, selectively enforced, and internally inconsistent. Pointing this out won't help when it's being used against you.

Don't be afraid to make someone mad after exhausting other options.  All progress hinges on the unreasonable man. This can only be done with extreme care. "If you want to make an omelet, you must be willing to break a few eggs"

Don't allow yourself to be responsible for things over which you have no control.
