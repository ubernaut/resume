# CH2M Hill/Veco Inc.
### January 2007 – January 2008

As a Digital Plant Analyst, worked in the fast paced oilfield process engineering design team, provided day to day technical support and troubleshooting with AutoCAD, Bentley digital plant design, AutoLisp Macro implementation, and assistant administrator of Bentley Document Databases.

#### BoM Exporter
- ***Programmer***  
Designed and implemented a Visual Basic tool to extract relevant data from any AutoCAD Bill of Materials generated by Bentley AutoPlant, and then transpose everything into a specific Excel deliverable format used by Conoco Phillips.

#### Server Patcher
- ***Programmer***  
Developed a batch script to automate patch deployment for AutoPlant users on the CH2M Hill network. The script iterated through a file containing a list of computers which needed the update, checked to see if the update has been applied already, and backed up old files before replacing them.

#### Data Fixer
- ***Programmer***  
Wrote queries designed to find and repair missing database fields by cross referencing recording and inserting data between databases.

#### Sharepoint Administrator
- ***Programmer***  
Posted training videos on the Design Technology Department’s SharePoint website at CH2M Hill by converting the videos to supported formats and writing the code on the aspx pages to embed the controls.

#### CH2M Course Complete App
- ***Programmer***
Designed, and implemented a database with a web front end used for keeping track of students and the courses they have taken in the training program at CH2M Hill.

#### Aux Scripts
- ***Programmer***  
Wrote auxiliary scripts to streamline the drafting of commonly used objects and entities where context specific requirements prevented the use of ‘Blocks’.

#### AutoCAD ExRef Preserver
- ***Programmer***  
Designed and implemented a tool to aid in the transfer of complex 3D models with hundreds of components from one project to another. A project generally contains numerous drawings which reference other drawings in the project. When copying the data from one project to another, many of the references break. Wrote a program to scan each file for broken references. ‘Re-Path’ would then recursively search the project directory tree for the location of each reference and re-establish the reference with the correct path.

#### AutoCAD Russian Translator
- ***Programmer***  
Assisted in the development, debugging and implementation of an ‘English to Russian’ translation tool for AutoCAD drawings. VTS (Veco Translation Software) pulled all text contained in a drawing file and placed them in an excel workbook column. Once in the workbook @prompt would make an attempt at translating everything and placing the translated text into an adjacent column. At this point translators had the opportunity to add dictionary words or correct mistakes made by @prompt before VTS recaptured the translated text back into the drawing.


#### AutoPlant Documentation
- ***Analyst***  
Wrote end-user software documentation and training manuals for cutting edge engineering design technology tools from Bentley Systems lacking documentation. Wrote software for design automation in Visual Basic and AutoLisp. Taught entry level courses in engineering design applications. Provided AutoCAD Support. Imported specs from parts suppliers in the SQL database used by AutoPlant to generate 3D models of each part.

# General Communications Inc.
### August 2005 – December 2006

As an Integrated Technical Support Representative, worked with customers over the telephone, solved various networking and cable T.V. issues in their homes, businesses, and within the GCI telecommunications network.


- ***Analyst***  
Provided support over the telephone for cable and internet customers using the GCI telecommunications network.

## Computer Science Student Projects

## Data Manager
- ***Programmer***  
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, created a database and web application to manage entities and users for a gravity simulation called ‘StableOrbit’.

## Client Server System
- ***Programmer***  
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, built on the existing StableOrbit Genetic Algorithm described later, added Client and Server functionality using XML RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and rewrote the math intensive physics portions in C. The Genetic Algorithm is now hosted on a server which deals out the heavy lifting work physics work to clients. When the client is finished computing the system it is returned to the server for storage in a database. These changes are the first steps towards creating a high performance distributed computing network for physics computation. Afterward was invited to Weber State University in the fall semester to give a presentation on the algorithms and artificial intelligence used therein.

## Stable Orbit
- ***Programmer***  
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, Artificial Intelligence Project, worked with a physics student from Weber State University, designed and implemented a Genetic Algorithm tasked with finding stable solar system configurations. Also built a viewing application which was used to view the solar system simulation rendered in 3D.

## Connect Four AI
- ***Programmer***  
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, worked in a team of two designing and implementing an AI in Java to play “Connect Four.” The algorithm used was an adversarial search called ‘Alpha Beta Pruning.’ It speeds up the search of the state space by eliminating the traversal of branches when better known alternative branches exist.


## Dedupester
- ***Programmer***  
At the University of Alaska Anchorage, worked in a team of four developing and testing a Java application to search a directory tree and locate and quarantine duplicate versions of the same file. Using the built in ‘Set’ data structure in java, the files were sorted by name and size. When a name and size collision occurred the path to the file was recorded in a text file for review by the user. Each duplicate was optionally moved to a common folder for the user to delete.
